Welcome
-------

Welcome to the home page of Base-Conversion-Kit. Here, I am going to show you how to interact with this plugin and use it to make your life easier, especially if you are a person that has to deal with a lot of math operations in different bases.

How to use
----------

This module has many different uses. The main functions are:


`convert_to_base_n(decimal_number, to_base)`

`convert_base(number, from_base, to_base)`

`add_numbers(a, b, base)`

`subtract_numbers(a, b, base)`

`multiply_numbers(num1, num2, base)`


Always, the numbers must be in string format. Otherwise, the functions might not work as expected. (Examples: "1A", "FF")

The bases, on the other hand, must be in int format. (Examples: "2", "8", "16")
